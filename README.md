# Vision
Vision is a torch shaped device to help blind people navigate with greater comfort, speed and confidence, whilst making use of ultrasonic waves to detect nearby obstacles and to notify the user through vibrations and beeps of a buzzer.

Aim of the Project : 
 1) To add a third method to the existing lot of two most common navigation techniques by the visually impaired (A simple stick- “The white cane” and A pet dog).  
 2) To make a device as small as a handy torch, functional and powered by simple electronics which will solve the above purpose.  
 3) To use accurate ultrasonic ranging method by the use of sensors to detect obstacles and to notify the user about their presence near them in different directions through vibrations and sound beeps.  
 4) To make it battery operated, long lasting, portable, open source, easily usable and explicit in calculations. 
 5) To make the device easily affordable by everyone, the total cost being less.
